# Transfer-Learning-for-Learning-Vector-Quantization
In Machine Learning, Learning Vector Quantization(LVQ) is well known as supervised learning method. LVQ has been studied to generate optimal reference vectors because of its simple and fast learning algorithm [12]. In many tasks of classification, different variants of LVQ are considered while training a model. In this thesis, the two variants of LVQ, Generalized Matrix Learning Vector Quantization(GMLVQ) and Generalized Tangent Learning Vector Quantization(GTLVQ) have been discussed. And later, transfer learning technique for different variants of LVQ has been implemented, visualized and we have compared the results using different datasets.
